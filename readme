#_printf



Recreate printf from scratch in C



##Function



The purpose of _printf is to mimic printf from stdio.h.



The prototype we used is "int _printf(const char *format, ...)" where format is a string and takes unlimited number of inputs as values. Returns number of chars printed.



'%' indicates when an additional value will be input, with the following letter acting as a flag:



##Flag Output



%c char %s string %S string, replace any unprintable chars as \xXXX where XXX is a hex with caps, must be at least two digits %d/%i int %o unsigned int as octal %u unsigned decimal int %x unsigned int as hex with lowercase letters %X unsigned int as hex with uppercase letters %b unsigned int as binary



##Example and output



int main(void) { _printf("%s\nprint a char: %c\nthis is an int: %d\nand an octal: %o\n", "this is a string", 'A', 98, 98);



return (0); }



OUTPUT



this is a string print a char: A this is an int: 98 and an octal: 142
